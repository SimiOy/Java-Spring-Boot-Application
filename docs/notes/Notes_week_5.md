# Notes Week 5

Date: 15/03/2022


# To do for this week

- Meeting on Wednesday at 14.00 at the library to dicuss the features/bugs we need to implement/fix
- Make sure the game actually ends, and add the temporary leaderboard
- Front end still needs some work
- Adding images to the activities/questions
- Avatar generator (front end), for players


## Things discussed

- Changes made in the last couple of weeks and what everyone managed to work on so far
- Showed a working demo to the TA (singleplayer + semi working multiplayer)


## Deadlines

- no deadlines have been dicussed 


## Extra notes

- Try to change back-end and front-end more frequently, and set up targeted questions for the ones that worked on back-end the previous week (so we can all understand the code and all the changes)
- Seperate branches if everybody is working on the same branch
- Imrpove task division so no overlap is done
- Merge always before Sunday

## TA Feedback

- The demo seemed fine

## Tips & Tops

**Tops**
* Evryone did their part
* Very few conflicts this week, which were all solved quickly 

**Tips**
* Push our branches a bit faster, merge requesting earlier, and try to keep features more minimised (distribute them to more branches)
* By doing so, it would allow for better reviews and easier code understanding
* Add more comments weekly
