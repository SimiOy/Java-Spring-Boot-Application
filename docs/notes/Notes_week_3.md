# To do for this week

* Team meeting on Tuesday: design prototype for the HCI assignment and heuristic evaluation for the other group's prototype
* Team meeting on Thursday: HCI assignment(report), decide on the architecture of the project and assign each person with a task for sprint 1
* Look at HCI assignment and materials: https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/le/content/399695/Home?itemIdentifier=D2L.LE.Content.ContentObject.ModuleCO-2337102
* Information literacy module has to be individually completed as soon as possible
* Sprint 1 tasks that is assigned to each one of us (minimum we can read the database or create and delete questions, some endpoints implemented)


## Decisions about the Gitlab repo

* Gitlab has 3 uses: to share code, tracker for what needs to be done, and to review code
* The code review process: pull the new branch and see if and how the code works, always add comments after checking the code before you approve
* The pipeline should build for every merge requests
* In order to eliminate conflicts in the code, one has to merge the main to the new branch and then merge the new branch to main 
* Issues created in gitlab can be linked to the branches that implements that specific issue


## Backlog

* There will be adjustments in the issues according to the reference backlog
* Backlog misses how the issues should be implemented and which issues are larger than others
* The way we decide which issues are bigger is by numbering them from 1 to 10 according to their workloads
