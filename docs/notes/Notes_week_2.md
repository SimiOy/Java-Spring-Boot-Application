# Notes Week 2

Date: 15/02/2022


# To do for this week

* Team meeting on Thursday: final backlog, code of conduct, decide which software environment we will use for HCI (for example https://moqups.com/)
* Look at HCI assignment and materials: https://brightspace.tudelft.nl/d2l/le/content/399695/Home?itemIdentifier=D2L.LE.Content.ContentObject.ModuleCO-2337102
* Read how to write a proper commit message

## Decisions about the Gitlab repo

* Keep dev branch
**Always merge dev with main until the end of the week**

## Backlog

**Must have section**: 
* The sentences have to contain the word "must". (minor fix)
* Some of them are not necessary for the program to run and are not main features (ex. power ups): should be moved to "should have" section.
* Replace "log in" with "authentication".

**Should have:**
* This section should not be only about multiplayer.

**Other:**
* Create a section "Won't have" and move some of the requirements to it (ex. authentication and disconnect)/write some non functional requirements.

## Deadlines

**Friday:**
* Code of conduct
* Backlog
* Agenda
* Meeting notes
* Teamwork Assignment 2B

**Other:**
* If we want feedback from the TA we have to send him the files **latest** the weekend before the deadlines.
* Every week check the code of conduct and update it accordingly

## Scrum

* You can watch the video https://youtu.be/eejL9duhlsA to learn more about this.
* Waterfall doesn't work.
* Agile workflows process: We are continuously producing something that works and we change the workflow based on how we evaluate the process.

**Plan, Work, Evaluate, Repeat**
