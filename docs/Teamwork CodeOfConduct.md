**Code of Conduct** 

In a Code of Conduct you discuss with each other what you expect from each other and from the collaboration. Everyone participates in this and supports the agreements that you draw up together. A Code of Conduct is a flexible document. If after some time it appears that certain agreements are not realistic or applicable, then it is important to discuss this in the group and adjust the agreements if necessary.


**Assignment description:**

In your own words, describe what you need to do as a group in this course.

We need to work well as a team to be able to develop a functioning and well-rounded product. We need to come up with a solid plan and stick to predetermined schedules so that we can be organised and efficient. After making plans and schedules (like meetings and sprint backlogs) we then need to split up tasks evenly so that everyone works on something different and then merge all our work together, while also informing each other about the progress that has been made. By repeatingly meeting, coming up with plans on how to move forward, work on separate tasks and then discuss our progress we will achieve our goal.


**Target or ambition level:**

What grade are you working for?

We are ambitious, optimistic and believe we can work together well so we hope our process of working together will enable us to make a working product adhering to most of the client’s requirements. So we are aiming for > 8.


**Products:**

What should you deliver at the end? On which platform do you share which documents (Discourse/Miro/MS Teams)? What standards must the work submitted meet?

At the end we should deliver a working functional quizz game that supports at least single-player games. Documents are shared on the public team’s Google Drive, where they are also edited (assignments that require Word editing of some sort). Other platforms for sharing documents are Discord and Gitlab (where we post meeting notes and agendas, besides other markdown files like the backlog). The work submitted must be thoroughly checked and approved by all members of the team.

**Planning:**

How do you ensure that each group finishes everything on time? Did you clarify who will have a final say in the final deliverable and submits it to Brightspace *on behalf of the project group?*

As a team, we try to reach our deadlines, and if one of us falls behind a simple heads-up from the others should be enough to get his work done. Nobody has a final say in the deliverables, as that would imply a hierarchy of some sort. All deliverables are checked and approved by all team members and the submission itself is done by anybody that offers himself.



**Behavior:**

How do you treat each other in the group? How do you handle disagreements within your group? Could your guide or student assistant be involved in reaching consent? What do you do if someone is late during a group meeting?

As a group, we decided to keep it professional each time we communicate. We treat each other with respect. Everytime an idea is raised, each of us gives their opinion on the idea and later, we decide whether to implement the idea or not. Our TA tries to keep away from the situations where we decide to implement an idea. However, in some conflicts that cannot be solved in a short amount of time, he gives his opinion and shares his experience which allows us to solve the disagreement in a shorter amount of time. We all try to be on time for the group meetings, but as we schedule many meetings throughout the week, sometimes one of us will be late. In this case, we inform the person that is late about what we did in that 5 minutes and give a quick heads-up that it should not happen again.


**Communication:**

In what ways do you communicate with each other as a group and among yourselves? (in the studio/MS Teams/Miro/Discourse)

We use discord for our main communication method. We have created a server which consists of text and voice channels. In the text channel, we communicate daily to see each other's progress and inform each other about what’s coming next in the project. We also use the text channel to get help if someone gets stuck in a part. However, our main communication tool is the voice channel that we use to organise our meetings. We try to schedule at least two meetings a week other than the weekly TA meeting, since it's our main source of communication and we get most of the job done in these meetings. In addition, we use google drive to exchange files and edit them simultaneously.


**Commitment:**

How do you determine the quality of each group's work, so that each group delivers the same quality? 

We determine the quality of each group's work by reviewing it together and we brainstorm a problem together when the group is not able to solve it.

How do you measure the commitment of the chairs and minute takers?

We measure the commitment of the chairs and the minute takers by the quality of the notes and the agenda they make. The agenda should be complete and non vague so everyone knows exactly what to do. The notes taken by the minute taker should cover all the aspects discussed during the meeting(without the opening discussion).


**Meetings:**

How often will you meet as a group? What preparation is needed for the meetings? 

We will meet at least 2 times a week as a group(depending on the volume of work the number may increase). We all need to prepare for the meeting the things established in the previous meeting with an overview of the work done in the meantime.

**Decision-making:**

How do you make decisions? By majority vote or by consensus?

We will make decisions by consensus, to try and not let any misunderstandings remain. This ensures that, as a group, we are all satisfied with the decisions. As opposed to a majority vote, consensus means there will not be any chances for grudges to form if a person is not convinced by the group’s decision. Generally, everything is discussed and everyone shares their opinion about any major decision in our project.




**Dealing with conflicts:** 

How do you handle conflicts within the group?

If any conflicts should rise, the other group members will be the first to act. We will try to find the root cause of the problem, so we can clear any misunderstandings. We think both sides of a conflict can have a correct point of view, so it is also important to understand the situation thoroughly and learn everything we can do to avoid any future disagreements.


**Guidance:**

What do you expect from the teacher's and/or student assistant’s guidance? What do you want feedback on, on the content or on the collaboration?

We expect the TA to answer our questions about the organisation of the course and warn us about deadlines and oddities that need extra caution. We also expect him to help us improve our meeting structure during the Tuesday lab session and give feedback on our teamwork assignments.


**Consequences:**

What are the consequences if a participant in the group does not keep the agreements?

When a participant does not keep up the agreements, the person will first be given a warning by the other team members. Then, if they do not make up for their mistakes, the TA will try to talk to them. After which they get a chance to make up for their slacking, if they do, all will be fine. But, if they do not, this will be reported to the TA again, who will handle it from there.


**Succesfactors:**

What makes your team a dream team?

-Good communication: We should be able to ask each other for help and advice, we also communicate clearly about whether we are on track for deadlines and what we expect each other to do in order to make those deadlines. We can also safely give each other tips about attitude or delivered work.

-Clear deadlines: We should have clear strategic deadlines that allow us to prioritise the work properly. This way we make sure that no team member is left behind and everybody is putting in the same amount of effort.

-Division of labour: We split up tasks and tackle them one at a time so that we can transform a large set of tasks which might seem overwhelming to a much smaller and doable set of tasks, distributed among us.

-Conflicts avoidance: By talking it out, or addressing certain issues or problems that may arise, we can ensure that further possible conflicts between team-members are avoided.
